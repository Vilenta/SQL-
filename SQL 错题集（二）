3/ show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
  解决答案：
  SELECT DISTINCT player 
  FROM goal JOIN game
  ON matchid = id 
  WHERE teamid != 'GER' AND (team1='GER' OR team2='GER');

4/List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.
   mdate	     team1	score1	team2	score2
1 July 2012   	ESP	    4	    ITA   	0
10 June 2012	  ESP   	1    	ITA   	1
10 June 2012	  IRL	    1	    CRO	    3
...
Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. 
You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.
  解决答案：
  SELECT mdate,team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score1,
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal              #使用LEFT JOIN 
  ON matchid = id 
  GROUP BY mdate,matchid,team1,team2;
